Quantity-Intensity Relationship of Soil Potassium

The quantity-intensity (Q/I) relationships, first introduced by Beckett (1964), can be employed to assess the K supplying capacity of different soils based on solid-solution exchange equilibria. Such relationships describe the changes in K+ concentration in the soil solution (or the intensity factor) in relation to the corresponding changes in K+ at exchange sites of the soil (or the capacity or quantity factor). Activity ratio of K to Ca or Ca+Mg is generally used as the variable denoting the intensity, whereas, change in exchangeable K is used to denote the quantity factor.
